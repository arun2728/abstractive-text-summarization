There were 516 homicides in New York City in 2008, according to preliminary police figures. The NYPD's CompStat data showed 516 homicides in the city last year, up from 496 in 2007.

Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Tariq Aziz, a top lieutenant of executed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, remained hospitalized at a U.S. military hospital Sunday after falling ill in prison, the U.S. command in Iraq reported. He was taken to the hospital Thursday, though no details of his ailment were released. But 1st Lt. Elizabeth Feste, a U.S. military spokeswoman, told CNN his condition was improving and he was being closely monitored. Aziz was one of the best-known faces of Hussein's government, serving as deputy prime minister from 1981 to 2003 and as foreign minister for part of that time. In March 2009, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison in connection with the 1992 executions of 42 merchants. He was captured by U.S. forces in April 2003, shortly after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the Hussein.

(CNN) -- Four days of heavy rains triggered a landslide that killed 12 children and eight adults near Mount Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania, authorities said Friday. Five of the children were under six, said Suzan Kaganda, a police department spokeswoman. The death toll could go up as rescue crews search the area for people reported missing, Kaganda said. Most victims of the late Tuesday landslide live in the Kilimanjaro region near the mountain by the same name, Kaganda said. The mountain is the highest peak in Africa and is a major tourist attraction. U.N. officials warned last month that east Africa is facing mudslides, crop destruction and waterborne diseases as a result of heavy downpour triggered by El Nino weather patterns.

There were 516 homicides in New York City in 2008, according to preliminary police figures. The NYPD's CompStat data showed 516 homicides in the city last year, up from 496 in 2007. That's still a dramatic change from 1990, when 2,262 homicides earned New York the title of ""murder capital"" of the nation.
